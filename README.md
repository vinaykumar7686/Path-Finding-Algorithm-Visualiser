# Path-Finding-Algorithm-Visualiser
A visualiser built on top of Pygame module to visualise the working of various Path Finding Algorithms.

Algorithms Currently Implemented:
- A* Path Finding Algorithm: A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, 
                             and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory.
                             A* search algorithm solves for single-pair shortest path using heuristics to try to speed up the search.
- Dijkstra's Path Finding Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
                                     It solves the single-source shortest path problem with non-negative edge weight.The major disadvantage of the algorithm is the fact that it                                        does a blind search there by consuming a lot of time waste of necessary resources.
