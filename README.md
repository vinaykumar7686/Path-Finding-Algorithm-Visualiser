# Path-Finding-Algorithm-Visualiser
A visualiser built on top of Pygame module to visualise the working of various Path Finding Algorithms.

Algorithms Currently Implemented:
- A* Path Finding Algorithm: A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, 
                              and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory.
